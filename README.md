# Linode + DEV Hackathon Challege - Baseball Management System (BMS)

In January 2023, I participated in the [Linode - DEV Hackathon Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-linode-dev-hackathon-377p) and was selected as a runner up among ten others.

The Linode - DEV Hackathon Challenge was organized by DEV and Linode to encourage developers to create innovative applications using a language of their choice and hosting the applications using Linode, a cloud computing service.

During the challenge, I developed the [Baseball Management System (BMS)](https://dev.to/.brandonmichaelhunter/linode-dev-hackathon-2lg6) using Django, Bootstrap, jQuery, and SQL Lite. I am proud of my achievement, as I had the opportunity to learn how to create a website using Django and SQL Lite.
